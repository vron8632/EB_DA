## Entropy Balancing Strategy for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation


## Overview

In the self-training method for unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation tasks, due to domain shift and
lack of manual labeling, pseudo-labels inevitably contain
noise. Existing methods usually alleviate the noise from
pseudo-labels by entropy regularization. However, excessive
regularization weakens the correct pseudo-labels and limits the performance of the principle of self-training entropy
minimization. On the basis of mixing the source domain
and the target domain, this paper further considers the entropy balancing strategy to “smooth out peaks and valleys”
of the entropy in the mixed domain, placing it in a relatively
balanced position. This is beneficial for increasing the prediction values with low certainty and reducing overconfident
prediction values. Our method is based on the widely adopted
Transformer baseline method DAFormer and obtains significant performance improvement by adding an entropy balance
loss in two adaptive semantic segmentation tasks: Cityscapes
→ ACDC and Cityscapes → FoggyCityscapes + RainCityscapes. Even under low resolution and limited graphics
memory conditions, our method still achieves competitive
results.

## Setup Environment

For this project, we used python 3.8.5. We recommend setting up a new virtual
environment:

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/daformer
source ~/venv/daformer/bin/activate
```

In that environment, the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

Further, please download the MiT weights and a pretrained DAFormer using the
following script. If problems occur with the automatic download, please follow
the instructions for a manual download within the script.

```shell
sh tools/download_checkpoints.sh
```

All experiments were executed on a NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti.

## Inference Demo

Already as this point, the provided DAFormer model (downloaded by
`tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be applied to a demo image:

```shell
python -m demo.image_demo demo/demo.png work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c.json work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/latest.pth
```

When judging the predictions, please keep in mind that DAFormer had no access
to real-world labels during the training.

## Setup Datasets

**Cityscapes:** Please, download leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip and
gt_trainvaltest.zip from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/)

The final folder structure should look like this:

```none

**Data Preprocessing:** Finally, please run the following scripts to convert the label IDs to the
train IDs and to generate the class index for RCS:

```shell
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/synthia.py data/synthia/ --nproc 8
```

## Training

For convenience, we provide an [annotated config file](configs/daformer/gta2cs_uda_warm_fdthings_rcs_croppl_a999_daformer_mitb5_s0.py) of the final DAFormer.
A training job can be launched using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/daformer/gta2cs_uda_warm_fdthings_rcs_croppl_a999_daformer_mitb5_s0.py
```

For the experiments in our paper (e.g. network architecture comparison,
component ablations, ...), we use a system to automatically generate
and train the configs:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp <ID>
```

More information about the available experiments and their assigned IDs, can be
found in [experiments.py](experiments.py). The generated configs will be stored
in `configs/generated/`.

## Testing & Predictions

The provided DAFormer checkpoint trained on GTA→Cityscapes
(already downloaded by `tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be tested on the
Cityscapes validation set using:

```shell
sh test.sh work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c
```

The predictions are saved for inspection to
`work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/preds`
and the mIoU of the model is printed to the console. The provided checkpoint
should achieve 68.85 mIoU. Refer to the end of
`work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/20211108_164105.log` for
more information such as the class-wise IoU.

Similarly, also other models can be tested after the training has finished:

```shell
sh test.sh path/to/checkpoint_directory
```

When evaluating a model trained on Synthia→Cityscapes, please note that the
evaluation script calculates the mIoU for all 19 Cityscapes classes. However,
Synthia contains only labels for 16 of these classes. Therefore, it is a common
practice in UDA to report the mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes only on these 16
classes. As the Iou for the 3 missing classes is 0, you can do the conversion
mIoU16 = mIoU19 * 19 / 16.

The results for Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich are reported on
the test split of the target dataset. To generate the predictions for the test
set, please run:

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --test-set --format-only --eval-option imgfile_prefix=labelTrainIds to_label_id=False
```

The predictions can be submitted to the public evaluation server of the
respective dataset to obtain the test score.

## Checkpoints

Below, we provide checkpoints of DAFormer for different benchmarks.
As the results in the paper are provided as the mean over three random
seeds, we provide the checkpoint with the median validation performance here.

* [DAFormer for Synthia→Cityscapes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V9EpoTePjGq33B8MfombxEEcq9a2rBEt/view?usp=sharing)

* [DAFormer for Cityscapes→DarkZurich](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VXKDhnp4x4sslBj5B8tqqBJXeOuI9hS/view?usp=sharing)

The checkpoints come with the training logs. Please note that:

* The logs provide the mIoU for 19 classes. For Synthia→Cityscapes, it is
  necessary to convert the mIoU to the 16 valid classes. Please, read the
  section above for converting the mIoU.
* The logs provide the mIoU on the validation set. For Cityscapes→ACDC and
  Cityscapes→DarkZurich the results reported in the paper are calculated on the
  test split. For DarkZurich, the performance significantly differs between
  validation and test split. Please, read the section above on how to obtain
  the test mIoU.
